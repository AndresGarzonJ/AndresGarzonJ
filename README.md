#### Hello good people &amp; bots of Github :octocat:

:speech_balloon:&nbsp;&nbsp; Mostly here to learn from others. I generally try to help folks make good use of the web by crafting custom applications. Fan of simplicity, sustainability, performance, efficiency, open, well documented, and function over form. Studio art major and reformed technology enthusiast.

:computer:&nbsp;&nbsp; ARM > x86. Vim > Emacs. Started with BASIC on an Apple II, managed to avoid C, and still haven't learned Rust. Perfectly capable of creating an unholy amalgamation of spaghetti code.
